# Git & Markdown

## Simple Exercise - edit, commit, and push

1. Fix the typo in [my-first-markdown.md](/modules/04-Git-and-Markdown/praxis/my-first-markdown.md)
   by changing "Markown" to Markdown. You should commit & push the change, and see the change in Github.

   * Notice how Github shows the Markdown file in a nice way. This is because it ends with ".md" and has "Markdown" in it.
   * VSCode also knows how to show markdown nicely. Just click on the preview icon on the top right in the editor.

1. [Learn markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
   You can play with all the options locally by changing `my-first-markdown.md` and previewing it in VSCode.
1. Recreate [this markdown](/modules/04-Git-and-Markdown/praxis/recreate-this.md)
   into a file named `recreated.md` in the same directory.

   * Don't cheat by looking at the file! And don't forget to commit and push the change.
   * You should check how it looks in Github.
