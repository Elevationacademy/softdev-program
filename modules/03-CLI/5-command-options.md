# Command options

* `cd ~`
* `ls -l`
* `-l` is a **command option** (I think it stands for "long")
* You can see all the options, and more, using `man ls`
* Many modern commands have a `-h` or `--help` option

# Summary

* ls -l: `-l` is the option in `ls` for "long format"
* man _command_: if you want information on a command
