# Install Git

Here you will install Git. Git is the #1 Source Control tool for developers. What's source control?
It's where developers store their code.

## Install Git

* Goto the site, and install from [there](https://git-scm.com/)
* Mac users: it's as easy as that.
* For Windows users: the installation will ask questions. Answer thus:
  * Configuring line ending: "Checkout as is, commit Unix-style line endings"
  * Adjusting your PATH: "Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt"
* We will continue this installation in the Git module, but for now, we're good.

## Test that Git works

* Open a "terminal" (Mac), or "Command Prompt" (Windows)
* Type `git --version` (note the 2 dashes, and the space before them) and press `enter`.
* You should see one or two lines describing git and the version installed.
* Windows: also open a new application called "Git Bash" and do the same.
