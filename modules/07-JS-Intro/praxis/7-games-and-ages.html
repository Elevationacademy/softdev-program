  Bonus:

  Write a page that includes three fields (and a button):
    * First player age (input type=number)
    * Second player age (input type=number)
    * game (input type=text)
    * button that validates and alerts with a message if it did not pass validation

    Validate that the games are one of this set:
    "Of Thrones" (Get it...? :->)
    "Monopoly"
    "Cards Against Humanity"
    "Rummikub"
    "Barbie"

    Implement a function isValidGame(gameName) to do this (it returns boolean). Test it!

    Validate also that the two players can play the game, using these rules:
      "Of Thrones" can only be played by two adults
      "Monopoly" can be played by anyone
      "Cards Against Humanity" can be played anyone, but if a child plays, the other player must be an adult
      "Rummikub" can be played by anyone
      "Barbie" can only be played by two children
      (An adult is 18 years or higher. A kid is not an adult.)

    Implement a function canPlay(gameName, age1, age2) which calls the following functions:
      canPlayOfThrones(smallAge, bigAge)
      canPlayMonopoly(smallAge, bigAge)
      ...

      Note the canPlay* functions get the ages sorted, so that they are simpler to implement. The canPlay
      function will use max and min functions to pass the correct ages to them.

      Test all functions! (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ILgK9AyhWdSVF5c3VNcGJrdFE/view)
