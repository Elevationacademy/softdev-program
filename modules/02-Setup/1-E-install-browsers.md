# Install Browsers

Yay! Our first exercise!

In this exercise you will install two browsers.

1. Chrome - see below for installation instructions
1. Firefox - see below for installation instructions

## Why do we need two browsers?

Because there are slight differences between them, and any serious front-end developer will need to test on both.
We _should_ also test on Safari and Internet Explorer, but for this course that's enough

## Install Chrome

* If you haven't already, install it.
* No need for an installation link - you can search for it on the internet.
* If you have installed it, make sure you have automatic updates on, and that you have the latest version.

## Install Firefox

* If you haven't already, install it.
* No need for an installation link - you can search for it on the internet.
* If you have installed it, make sure you have automatic updates on, and that you have the latest version.
