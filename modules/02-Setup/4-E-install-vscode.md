# Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is the editor we will be using during our whole program. This is your most important tool,
so you will be intimately familiar with it at the end of the program. In the meanwhile, let's just download it.

## Install Visual Studio Code

* Install from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Check that it runs

   * Auto Complete Tag
   * Code Runner
   * ESLint
   * Git History
   * HTML Hint
   * Open in Github
   * View in Browser
   * EditorConfig for VS Code

1. How to install a plugin:
   * Run Visual Studio Code (henceforth known as VSCode)

   * In the search bar of the panel that opened, write the name of the Extensions
   * In the search result, click on the "Install" button of the Extensions
   * You can reload VSCode only after you installed all the plugins
