# Cloning the Softeng Repository

Finally you can clone the repository we've all been looking at.

We first need to clone _this_ repository.
But there is a problem - we will need to `push` to this repository,
but you don't have write access to it. So what do we do? We **fork**.

1. Go to this repository - `https://github.com/create-softeng/softeng-program`
1. Click on "Fork". On the opening dialog, choose your private user.
1. And it's forked at `https://github.com/<your-username>/softeng-program`!

This new repo is a "fork" of the original repo.
The simplest way to think of it, is that this is a _copy_ of the original repo.

1. Now clone it. But first we need to create a directory where all our work is done:
1. Create a directory called `code` (or `work` or `projects` or `stuff`).
1. cd into it.
1. Now clone it, as explained in theory time.
1. cd into the repository
1. Let's open it in VSCode:
1. Run `code .`
1. Yes!
