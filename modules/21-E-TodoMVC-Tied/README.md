# TodoMVC - Completed

In this exercise, we will now combine the HTML/CSS done previously, with the Ajax/Server done.

## Steps

### Combine the two

1. Work in the todomvc you created earlier.
1. Start with the HTML/CSS you wrote in the TodoMVC-HTML
1. Add to it the server and the ajax code.

And it works! And it looks nice!

### Add Missing functionality

1. Add delete functionality
1. Add 'check completed' functionality
