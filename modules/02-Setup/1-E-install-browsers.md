# Install Browsers

Yay! Our first exercise!

In this exercise you will install two browsers.

1. Chrome - see below for installation instructions
1. Firefox - see below for installation instructions

## Why do we need two browsers?

Because there are slight differences between them (when browsing through the websites you will create),
and any serious front-end developer tests on both.
We _should_ also test on Safari and Internet Explorer, but for this course these two browsers are good enough.

## Install Chrome

1. If you haven't already, install it.
1. No need for an installation link - you can search for it on the internet.
1. If you have installed it, make sure you have automatic updates on, and that you have the latest version.

## Install Firefox

1. If you haven't already, install it.
1. No need for an installation link - you can search for it on the internet.
1. If you have installed it, make sure you have automatic updates on, and that you have the latest version.
