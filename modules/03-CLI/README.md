# CLI

* The **CLI** (Command Line Interface) is where you will be spending a lot of your time.
* Developers don't always work with graphical programs, but sometimes want quick commands that they can compose
  together to build complex stuff.
* These quick commands are called the CLI.

## Types of CLIs

* Three main CLIs in the world:
  * Windows CMD
  * Windows Powershell
  * **Unix shell**
* The most important and widely used one is the Unix shell,
  but to understand the differences, we need to understand what Unix is.

## Operating Systems (OSes)

* An **operating system** is the first program that runs on your computer.
* It ends only when you turn off your computer
* It is the program that is responsible for running all the other programs
* It is also responsible for the interface that is shown to the user
* There are two main OSes in the world:
  * **Unix** - free and open source
  * **Windows** - costs and closed source
* Unix branches into many many variants of it. The main ones are:
  * Linux
  * MacOS (previously called OS X)
* Linux itself branches into many many variants, called "distros" (from "distributions"):
  * Ubuntu
  * Debian
  * Redhat
  * Fedora...
* The differences between all the Unix variants are minimal, and we won't really encounter them in this program.
* And they all share the same CLI, called the Unix Shell.

## Why we don't learn CMD and Powershell

* Because they're not as popular as the Unix Shell.
* Because everything is based on the Unix Shell.

## Running the Unix Shell in Windows

* Easy - just run "Git Bash". That's a *simulation* of a Unix Shell
* What's **Bash**? It's a more modern version of the original Unix shell - **sh**.

So let's start learning!
