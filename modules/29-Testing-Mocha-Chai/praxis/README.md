## Fix Bugs in utils.js

* In the [workfiles](../workfiles) directory, you will find `test-utils` directory.
* They are a copy of the test-utils code and its test that we saw in class.
* In class, we saw that it's not green.
* Make it green.


Hint:

1. `npm install` to install mocha/chai
1. `npm test` to run the tests
1. Fix bugs (using `console.log` to help you with what the problem is)
1. Run `npm test`. Repeat until all is "green".


## Add tests to your model

* Copy the `test-members.js` to your project and ensure it works with your code.
* Add tests for all the other modules
