# Install NodeJS

NodeJS (also called "Node") is a program that allows us to run JavaScript programs in the command line.
We will be using it extensively.

## Install NodeJS

* Goto [this](https://nodejs.org/en/) link, and install the latest NodeJS (the one called "Current")

## Test that NodeJS works

* Open a "terminal" (Mac), or "Command Prompt" (Windows)
* Type `node --version` (note the 2 dashes, and the space before them) and press `enter`.
* You should see one or two lines describing NodeJS and the version installed.
