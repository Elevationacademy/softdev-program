# Model

* This is the model of taskboard, implemented
* Go through `members.js` a bit. Specifically discuss
  * `model.js` as a singleton
  * The structure of the model
  * The use of `uuid`
* Lots of code, but not tested, we need to test it!
* But before we do that, let's start by testing something much simpler
* Let's continue to the [next directory](../2-mocha), which we test a simple file named `util.js`
  that contains various utility functions
