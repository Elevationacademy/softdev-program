/**
 * Write a program that outputs the average of `4`, `5`, and `6`, using a function
 * `average3(a, b, c)` that accepts three parameters and returns the average.
 * It should not calculate the sum by itself, but should rather use the sum3 function you previously wrote.
 *
 * Don't forget to test the function!
