# Mission

Bonus!!!

Write a page that asks the user (using a form) for a number,
and shows that number of recent photos from Flickr, using the Flickr API.

You need to learn the Flickr API by yourself, specifically using:

* [Getting an API key](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/)
* [How a Flickr URL for an image looks like](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html)
* [How to fetch JSON data from Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/request.rest.html)
* [The API to fetch recent pictures](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getRecent.html)

The HTML of the exercise has a skeleton of the code, which you need to fill in.
