# Another repo

We'll clone another repo. A famous open-source project repo

1. Clone the [bluebird Github repo](git@github.com:petkaantonov/bluebird.git)
   * Bluebird is an open-source project
1. Change the readme
1. Add a file in one of the directories.
1. Now have _two_ commits with _meaningful_ messages, one for each of the above changes.
1. Try and push the change (it will fail, because you have no authorization there).
1. Fork the repo to your user.
1. _Change_ the 'origin' remote to _your_ fork. Yes, we know you haven't been taught that. Look on the internet
   for how to do it!
1. Now you can push your changes.
1. Add an 'upstream' remote, so you can pull changes from the original 'bluebird' repo.
1. Pull from it. (it shouldn't bring in anything, but at least it won't fail.)
