Using the Code in this module
-----------------------------

Besides a few directory that are self-contained, all modules here are run from the package in _this_ directory.
So to run the sample in a directory:

1. `npm install` this directory.
1. `MODULE=<module-number> npm run dev` to run webpack-dev-server on that directory, for example
   `MODULE=200 npm run dev`.

If the package _does_ have a package json, just `npm install` it and `npm run dev`.
