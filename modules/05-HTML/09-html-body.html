<!--
  * doctype - crucial, unless you want your page to be backward compatible with the 90s.
  * html tag
  * head and body tags
  * They are not indented, but that's an exception!
  * title tag
  * meta charset tag - must be there to support unicode characters (e.g. emoji and hebrew)
  * All code should use this skeleton, but our examples will still be bare in order to concentrate on the important
  * code.
  * Emmet in VSCode
