/**
 * Bonus:
 *
 * Write a program that accepts a file or directory as an argument
 *
 * If it is a file, just delete it
 * If it is a folder, delete all the files in it, and then delete the directory. Assume
 * that the directory does not include another directory.
 *
 * To delete a directory, search the documentation of the fs module (https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)
 * to see how it's done.
 *
 * Bonus: if the directory contains a directory too, delete it "recursively" beefore
 * deleting the parent directory.
 *
 * BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THIS PROGRAM. YOU MAY DELETE A WHOLE DIRECTORY.
