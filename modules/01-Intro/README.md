# INTRO

Welcome to the Software Development Program!

## Personal introduction

* Let's get to know each other!

## Communication

* Slack will be our main way to communicate
* All Slack communication will be in *English*
* The following Slack channels will be used:
  * `#random`: funny stuff that you want to share
  * `#praxis`: the teachers will be sending you material to do via this channels
  * `#need-help`: where you request help from other students and from the teachers
  * `#knowledge-sharing`: where you can post links about interesting stuff (pertaining to the course)
    that you found on the internet
  * `#foooood`: tips for nice (or not nice) places you find in the area. Recipes are also welcome!
  * `#general`: we don't really know what to put here, but it *sounds* very useful...
* Please set your notifications however you like, but you should set `#praxis` notifications so that you
  are sure to receive them.
* It's OK to DM (Direct Message) the teachers and not only go through the public channels.
  Please! We are here to help, so feel free to DM us on anything.
* Most important of all - we are also available "offline", so if anything is bothering you
  (or you just plain want to discuss something), and you wish to talk about it face to face, just tell us.

## Logistics (class, kitchen)

* Keep everything clean
* You can eat and drink in the class, but please don't be slobs
* Whatever is in the kitchen, feel free to use, but please clean after you, and wash any dishes you use
* The class is yours from 8:30 to 16:30. If you wish to work afterwards, you can do it at home, but remember
  that the Slack channels are always there for you. Get used to working like a real software developer - from home!

## Using the program's materials

* All the course materials (including this introductino) will be in this "repository"
* We will talk about how to use this "repository", and what kind of repository it is, later
* In the meantime, you were sent the web link to the repository via Slack

## Schedule

* The course is a 34 week course, which is a bit less than 8 months
* In the middle, you will be getting a one week vacation
* The course is divided into the following:
1. **Basics** (8 weeks):  we learn basic frontend and backend development - basic HTML, basic CSS,
    and the basics of programming in JavaScript.
1. **Frontend development** (10 weeks): we continue honing our frontend skills,
    learning more HTML, more CSS, and diving into the React JavaScript framework.
    While most of the time is dedicated to frontend,
    we continue to enhance our backend NodeJS skill so that by the end of this time
    we are able to do a two week project where we build a web application (both backend and frontend).
    This project also makes use of the Continuous Integration pipeline we have built during these 10 weeks.
1. **Vacation!** (1 week). All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
1. **Backend development & Mobile** (6 weeks): we learn advanced backend development, including the use of databases,
    while implementing a micro-services architecture using Docker and Docker Swarm.
    We also learn Java and build a simple mobile application.
1. **Continuous Delivery and DevOps** (4 weeks): we learn how to build a continuous delivery pipeline,
    and deploy our projects to the cloud.
1. **Capstone Project** (4 weeks): the culmination of everything we learned.
    We divide into 5-person teams, and implement a web application (both backend and frontend),
    fully tested, fully automated, and deployed to the cloud using the CI/CD pipeline we built during the program.
1. **Interview Preparation** (1 week): the last week is devoted to preparing ourselves
    to the interviews they will encounter.

### Projects

Interspersed in the program are three projects of increasing length and complexity:

1. **Website**: a one-week project, in which the student builds a brochure website
1. **Webapp**: a two-week project, in which the student pairs with another student to build a web application
   that includes both backend and frontend code
1. **Capstone project**: a four-week project, where the student joins a team of 5,
   and experiences the thrill and stress of building a real application with a real team

### Daily schedule

(1 hour)

From Sunday to Tuesday, the day will look like this:

* **Challenge**: The first hour will be devoted to a progamming challenge (not in the first days)
* **Theory**: The next three hours will be theory
* **Lunch**
* **[Praxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis)**: The last four hours will be devoted to practicing the theory.
  You may need to finish your assignments at home.

Wednesday, which we call "*Project Wednesday*", is a day which is all exercises or mini-projects.
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday are free, but you may need to work on finishing your weekly assignments.
Please, for the love of God (or whichever deity you worship), do *not* work on Saturdays!

### Program modules

* The program is divided into modules.
* Each module is under the [modules](/modules) folder.
* A module should take one day of study (theory + praxis)
* They are sorted by the order they are encountered in the program
* Each module includes a README (like this one!) describing what will be studied, and sometimes more.
* Each module will include a numbered list of files that are the theory of that module:
  * readme files (with a `.md` extension)
  * source code (with a `.js`, `.html`, `.css` (and others) extensions)
  * Exercises that will be done _during_ theory time. These are marked with `-E-` in their name.
* Each module will also include a folder named `praxis` that includes the exercises for that day.
  * Each file marked `-E-` is an exercise. Their may be other files there that are needed by the exercise.
    They will not be marked with `-E-`.

## What we expect from you

* Work hard. Even after the daily praxis time if needed. Even on Thursdays if needed.
* If you finished your assignments, you don't have to anything more to do! But others may need
  help. Help them!
* Help others even if you haven't finished your assignments. Team work is important.
* Don't work on Saturdays
* Laptops can be open during theory time, but please don't browse the internet during that time.
* If you get stuck, *ask for help*. And realizing that you are stuck should *not* happen after an hour. It can
  definitely happen after just 5 or 10 minutes. So please - *ask for help*.
* Don't hesitate to ask questions, all the time. That question that you think is dumb - it isn't. Really it isn't.
  If you don't ask that question, you will miss out on the material, and it will be harder for you and for us during
  praxis.
* Don't be afraid. Don't be ashamed. We are here to help you along your way to become software engineers. Fear is
  the number one inhibitor of learning. Don't be afraid:

> I must not fear.<br/>
> Fear is the mind-killer.<br/>
> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br/>
> I will face my fear.<br/>
> I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br/>
> And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.<br/>
> Only I will remain.<br/>
> - The Litany of Fear, Dune, Frank Herbert

* [Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome): the feeling we all have that we
  are not smart, and that sooner or later everybody will figure that out.
* Fight impostor syndrome. If you feel stupid, then you aren't. Really - you aren't.
* Work hard
* Ask questions
* Ask for help during praxis
* Don't be afraid
* Fight impostor syndrome

## What you should expect from us

* Courtesy and kindness
* Profressionalism
* Knowledge of the material at hand
* Helping you whenever you ask for help. Helping you is *not* necessarily feeding you the answer, as it can
  be a hint that *leads* you to the answer, or a link where you will find the answer.
* Mistakes. Yes, we also make mistakes. Moreover, sometimes you will ask a question that we don't know the answer
  to. We actually love those questions! But you should eventually expect an answer,
  even if it is after an hour or a day.

## Code of conduct

The code of conduct is applicable both to the students and to the teachers.

* Don't be a jerk. Don't be an asshole. It's not that complicated.
* The following were stolen unashamedly from [the recurse center](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment):
* No feigning surprise: please don't say things like "What?! You don't know that in JS arrays start from 0!?". If you
  say it, please *will* feel stupid, and will be afraid of saying things, and we do not want that.
* No well-actuallys: please don't try to sound smart and add a "well, actually..." and then give a minor correction.
  Especially if what you're saying has no bearing on the conversation. Trying to make yourself look smart also
  leads to making others look stupid, and we do not want that.
* No subtle-isms: No racism, sexism, or other forms of bigotry. This is actually a hard rule to follow, as
  sometimes we inadvertently break this rule, as these things can be subtle. If you feel you've been hurt
  by one of these, please point them out to the person, or to one of the teachers, and move on. Shaming is strictly
  prohibited. If there is a recurring pattern from one of the teachers or students, please *immediately* talk
  to the head of the school.
