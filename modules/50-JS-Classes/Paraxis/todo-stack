# Mission

Create a todo stack using classes (Object Oriented)

A stack is a data structure that saves objects in LIFO (Last in First out) order.
a stack has 2 main functions:
Push that gets a new object and adds it to the structure.
Pop that returns the last entered object and deletes it from the structure.

## Hint

1. Look at the 02-classes-multiple.js example.
   In the example TodoList class is managing a simple data structure (list).
   In this praxis you will replace the TodoList Class with a Stack class.

2. Build a todo class.
   You can use one of the examples shown in class.
   You can also use the todo id to make sense.

3. Build a stack class.
   The class will have an array of ToDo objects.

4. Add Push function.
   The function should get a ToDo object as parameter
   and add it to array of ToDo objects.
   Javascript arrays have push function too.

5. Add Pop function
   The function should make a copy of the last entered ToDo object from the list,
   delete it from the list, and return the copy
   How can you know which object was entered last?
   Javascript arrays don't have pop function. You need to use other functions.

6. Test your classes
