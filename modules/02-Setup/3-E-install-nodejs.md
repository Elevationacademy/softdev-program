# Install NodeJS

NodeJS is a program that allows us to run JavaScript programs in the command line. We will be using it extensively.

## Install NodeJS

* Goto [this](https://nodejs.org/en/) link, and install the latest NodeJS (the one called "Current")

## Test that NodeJS works

* Open a "terminal" (or Command Prompt in Windows)
* Type `node --version` (note the 2 dashes, and the space before them) and press `enter`.
* You should see one or two lines describing Node and the version installed.
