<!--
  Write a page that includes 3 numeric fields (<input type=numeric>),
  and a button that computes the average of the three fields: when the button is pressed it inserts
  the average into a div.
  Use a function `average3` that computes the max of the 3 values. Don't forget to test it...

  Remember:
  * use document.getElementById('_the_id_of_the_element_').value; to get the string value. Don't forget to parseInt it.
  * use document.getElementById('_the_id_of_the_element_').innerHTML = ...; to set the text of a div
