# Setup

(1 hour)

What's a developer without her tools? We will start by installing a set of tools that we will need in the first
few weeks.

We will install:

* Browsers
* A code editor
* Git
* NodeJS

You may not totally understand what each of these does. That's OK - we promise that by the end of the first two weeks
you will understand them all.

## This Repo

* Also, please goto the repo where this readme is in: [here](https://github.com/create-softeng/program).
* You will need to follow everything here.
* All the modules are in the `modules` folder.
