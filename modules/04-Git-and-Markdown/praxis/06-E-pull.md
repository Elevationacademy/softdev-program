# Git pull

To make a pull, we need something to pull, so we'll do what the teacher did - change a file directly
on the server, and pull that change.

1. Change a file on the Github server using the Github UI.
   Change the file [my-first-markdown.md](/modules/04-Git-and-Markdown/praxis/workfiles/my-first-markdown.md)]
   by adding a paragraph.

   * This generates a new commit in the server

1. Now change a file (a different file!) in your local repository.
   Change the file `recreated.md` which you created previously, by adding something at the end.
1. Commit the change.
1. Now try to push.
1. Ensure that it failed.
1. Now pull.
1. And push.
1. Check that your change is on Github using the Github GUI
