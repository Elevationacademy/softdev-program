<!--
  * Anything returned by getElementById is a Node in the DOM (Document Object Model).
  * A node can be anything.
  * It is a JS object, so it has properties, but it is special - when you change the keys, things change
    in the browser!

  * the property textContent is the content inside the HTML tag. You can use it using e.textContent
  * To change it, just assign to it, just like any object property.
