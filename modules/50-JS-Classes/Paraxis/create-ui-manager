# Mission

Create a simple UI manager that implements a dynamic creation of controls: button, label and panel
You'll be using HTML divs for all controls.

General:
Each control has its width, height, top and left values

Button:
Rectange with frame, color and text.
On click it alerts its name.

Label:
Text that is shown in the page

panel
Rectangle with frame and color that can contain buttons and labels on it

## Hint

1. Look at the static HTML first that has divs for a button, label and panel that's holding them
   Use sub divs if nessecary.
2. Your mission is to create classes that manages dynamic creation of controls.
3. Start with the classes. Do you need a base class? If so, what will it contain?
4. After implementing the classes, test them with console logs
5. If everything is all right you can move on to creating the elements on an HTML page.
