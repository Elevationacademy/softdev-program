# Cloning your friend's repo

We'll clone another repo. Your friend's repo.

## Creating your repo

1. Create a repo in Github. It should include at least a readme.
1. Now clone it to your computer.
1. Add two files, and change the readme.
1. Commit and push the changes. Verify that they're in Github.

## Cloning another repo

1. Find somebody (you can look to your left to find them)
1. Ask them, nicely, so send you their Github repo, which they created above.
1. Clone it.
1. Add a file with your name, and a nice greeting for your friend.
1. Commit it.
1. Push it. Oops, it failed! Because you have no authorization
1. Ask your friend to add you as a collaborator (It's in the "Settings" tab in their repo in Github)
1. Now try and push it.
1. Ask them to pull it.
