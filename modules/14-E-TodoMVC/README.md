# Mission

Write the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application.
It need not be as beautiful as the examples - semantic HTML is OK.
No need the filtering mechanism as in the official TodoMV, or the "2 left" status indicator.

## Requirements

* Make it good looking

## Bonus

* Add the filtering capability
