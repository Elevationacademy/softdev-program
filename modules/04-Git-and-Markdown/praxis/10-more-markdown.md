# Creating Your CV Using Markdown

1. Create your CV using Markdown
1. The CV should be in a directory named `cv` in your softdev-program repo (in the root directory)
1. It should include sections for "Experience", "Hobbies", "Education".
1. The experience should have a sub-heading for each previous job (if you didn't have one, invent ones!)
1. Same for "Education" and "Hobbies".
1. Each "Education" section should include a list of things you enjoyed and didn't in that institution.
1. Throw in some italics and bolds for a nice effect.
1. Don't forget to add your picture!
1. Commit it and check that it looks nice.
