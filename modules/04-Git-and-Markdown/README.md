# What is Git

* Git is a source control system
* Git runs locally
* Git stores the source control in **repositories**
* You can have (and probably do have) multiple repositories
* Git stores versions
* Each version is also called a **commit**
* Local git <--- pull --- Git Server
* Local git ---- push --> Git Server
* It is very complicated
* The best way to understand it is to work with it

## What we will learn

* Only the basics needed for a one-person team:
* git add
* git commit
* git log
* git push
* git pull
* git remote add upstream

## What we will not learn

* We will not learn what is needed for a _team_ of developers:
* branches
* merges and rebases
* conflict resolution
