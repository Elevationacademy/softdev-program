1. Style it

## Requirements

1. Style it so that it looks nice. Don't try to layout it. Just fonts, colors, margins, padding...
1. A bit of layout using inline-block is allowed, if you feel adventorous.
1. The current menu item, when hovered over, should be a different color, and bolder?
1. Also, use the css to make a multi-level menu.
1. The menu items, assuming you chose ul/li, should not show the bullet (how? look it up on the internet!) and
   should be displayed next to each other and not below each other (how? inline-block anybody?)
1. The image, when hovered over, will show another image.
