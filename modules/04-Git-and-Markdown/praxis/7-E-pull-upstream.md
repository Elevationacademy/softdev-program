# Pulling Changes from the Original Repository

The teachers have just updated this page with additional instructions,
but they are in the original repo and not your forked one. You need to get them and follow them:

1. Create a remote pointing to the original repo (usually named `upstream`)
1. Get the changes from the original repo. Remember! The changes are in the `master` branch.
1. Follow them.
