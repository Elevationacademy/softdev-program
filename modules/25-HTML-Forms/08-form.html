<!--
  * <form action>: where to send the **named** inputs. (if the input is not named, it won't be sent.)
  * The method is _how_ to send the named inputs.
  * The GET method sends it to a URL, and adds the named inputs as "urlencoded": name=value&name=value&...
  * To submit the form, you need to add an <input type=submit>.
  * You can also press enter to submit.

  * The URL here is a dummy server. Do `npm install` and then `npm start` to run it.
